Sudoku Solver & Generator – Project Explanation

---

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a complete Sudoku game built using React. It combines frontend UI development with algorithmic problem solving. The application allows users to play Sudoku, validates their moves, and visually demonstrates how a Sudoku solver works.

The project was intentionally developed over multiple days with daily GitHub commits to simulate real-world software development practices.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY

1. Sudoku Board

* 9×9 grid rendered using reusable Cell components
* Thick borders visually separate 3×3 sub-grids

2. Puzzle Generator

* Generates a fully solved Sudoku board using a backtracking solver
* Randomly removes numbers to create a playable puzzle
* Pre-filled cells are marked as fixed and locked

3. Move Validation

* Each user input is validated using Sudoku rules
* Invalid moves are rejected immediately
* Ensures correctness during gameplay

4. Sudoku Solver

* Uses a classic backtracking algorithm
* Recursively tries valid numbers in empty cells
* Guarantees a correct solution if one exists

5. Solver Visualization

* Cells that were empty before solving are tracked
* When Solve is clicked, only solver-filled cells are highlighted
* This visually explains how the solver completes the puzzle

6. UX Enhancements

* Dark theme UI
* Keyboard input support
* Selected cell highlighting
* Locked pre-filled cells cannot be edited

---

TECHNICAL DECISIONS

* React Hooks are used for state management
* Board state is immutable to avoid side effects
* Solver logic is separated from UI logic
* Clear separation of concerns using utils and components

WHY THIS PROJECT IS IMPORTANT

This project demonstrates:

* Strong understanding of React fundamentals
* Ability to integrate algorithms into UI
* Attention to UX and product details
* Clean and maintainable code structure
* Consistent GitHub contribution habits

INTERVIEW EXPLANATION (SHORT)

"I built a Sudoku application using React that includes a puzzle generator, move validation, and a backtracking solver. The app visually highlights solver-filled cells, locks pre-filled numbers, and focuses heavily on clean UX and maintainable state management."

POSSIBLE FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

* Difficulty selector (Easy / Medium / Hard)
* Timer and score tracking
* Puzzle uniqueness validation
* Mobile responsiveness
* Deployment to Vercel or Netlify
