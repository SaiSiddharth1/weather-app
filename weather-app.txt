WEATHER APP – INTERVIEW NOTES

PROJECT OVERVIEW
I built a Weather Application using React and a public weather API (OpenWeatherMap).
The app allows users to search weather by city and also automatically detects the user’s location to show current weather.

TECH STACK
- React (Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Git & GitHub (branch-based workflow)

KEY FEATURES
1. City-based weather search
2. Auto-detect user location using browser Geolocation API
3. Real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, condition)
4. Loading state while fetching data
5. Error handling for invalid city names and API failures
6. Clean and modular component architecture

PROJECT STRUCTURE
- components/
  - SearchBar.jsx (controlled input for city search)
  - WeatherCard.jsx (displays weather data)
- services/
  - weatherApi.js (handles all API calls)
- utils/
  - constants and helpers
- App.jsx (state management and main logic)

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS USED
- React Hooks: useState, useEffect
- Controlled components
- Lifting state up
- API abstraction (service layer)
- Async / await with try-catch-finally
- Conditional rendering
- Defensive coding using optional chaining
- Environment variables for API keys
- Branch-based Git workflow

GIT WORKFLOW
- main branch kept stable
- Feature branches used for daily development
- Each feature merged into main after testing

INTERVIEW EXPLANATION (SHORT)
I built a React-based weather application that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Users can search by city or allow location access to automatically load local weather.
The app follows clean component architecture with proper loading and error handling.

INTERVIEW EXPLANATION (DETAILED)
The application is built using React functional components and hooks.
All API calls are abstracted into a service layer to keep the code clean and maintainable.
I implemented browser geolocation to fetch weather using coordinates and added loading and error states to improve user experience.
The project follows a branch-based Git workflow similar to real industry projects.

RESUME BULLET
Developed a React weather application with real-time API integration, geolocation support,
and robust loading and error handling using modern React patterns.
